== About me
I'm an incoming student at [https://www.ece.uw.edu/ UW ECE], co-advised by Professor [https://people.ece.uw.edu/fazel_maryam/ Maryam Fazel] and Professor [https://vchariso.gitlab.io/ Vasileios Charisopoulos]. 

Previsouly at Berkeley, I worked with Professor [https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~kannanr/ Kannan Ramchandran] in the department of [https://eecs.berkeley.edu/ EECS], and spent the majority of undergraduate years at [https://bliss.eecs.berkeley.edu/ Berkeley Lab for Information and System Sciences]. I explored signal processing algorithms and explainable models. The people there made this experience the best I could ask for: [https://erginbas.github.io/ Efe], [https://landonbutler.github.io/ Landon], [https://justinkang221.github.io/ Justin], [https://www.linkedin.com/in/mert-cemri-4a727913a/ Mert], [https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewqin/ Andrew], [https://www.linkedin.com/in/sultan-daniels/ Sultan], [https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-archer-756156182/ Chris], [https://sites.google.com/view/syomantak Syomantak], and [https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-xu-233a0a72/ Eric]. 

I also worked with Professor [https://yanchiwei.github.io/ Chiwei Yan] in the department of [https://ieor.berkeley.edu/ IEOR]. When I was working with him on math proofs and coding, he was very patient to me and very sharp. He taught me how to find directions when I'm lost, and helped me build habbits necessary for the field. I couldn't ask for a better guidence to research than what he provided me with.
